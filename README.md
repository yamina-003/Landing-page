# Landing-page
This project is part of The Odin Project. The assignment was to build a simple landing page by following a design given as a PNG file.

The main goal was to practice laying out a page using HTML and CSS. Since the design included different sections, I had to figure out how to structure and style each part so that everything looked close to the reference image.

What I Learned:

  -Setting up the structure of a webpage with HTML.

  -Styling and organizing content with CSS.

  -Getting much more comfortable using Flexbox to handle different layouts.

  -Playing around with spacing, alignment, and some new CSS properties.

Project Files:

  -index.html → the page itself

  -style.css → the styling rules

  -images/ → contains the reference design and any assets

Reflection

I really enjoyed this project because it gave me the chance to actually use Flexbox in different ways. At first it felt tricky, but by the end I felt much more confident with layouts. It also made me realize how small CSS tweaks can completely change how clean a page looks.
